OpenQML ProjectQ Plugin
#######################

OpenQML is a Python quantum machine learning library by Xanadu Inc. This plugin allows to use both the software and hardware backends of ProjectQ as devices for quantum machine learning with OpenQML.


Installation
============

.. [//]: # (.. include:: doc/installation.rst)

This plugin requires Python version 3.5 and above, as well as OpenQML and ProjectQ. Installation of this plugin, as well as all dependencies, can be done using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install openqml_pq

To test that the OpenQML ProjectQ plugin is working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

in the source folder.


Getting started
===============

You can instantiate a 'projectq.simulator' device for OpenQML with:

.. code-block:: python

    import openqml as qm
    dev = qm.device('projectq.simulator', wires=2)

This device can then be used just like other devices for the definition and evaluation of QNodes within OpenQML. As simple quantum function that returns the expectation value of a measurement and depends on three classical input parameters would:

.. code-block:: python

    @qm.qfunc(dev)
    def circuit(x, y, z):
        qm.RZ(z, wires=[0])
        qm.RY(y, wires=[0])
        qm.RX(x, wires=[0])
        qm.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        return qm.expval.PauliZ(wires=1)

You can then execute the circuit like any other function to get the quantum mechanical expectation value.

.. code-block:: python

	circuit(0.2, 0.1, 0.3)

Running your quantum machine learning code on an IBM Quantum Experience simulator or even a real hardware chip is just as easy. Instead of the device above, you would instantiate a 'projectq.ibm' device by giving your IBM Quantum Experience username and password:

.. code-block:: python

    import openqml as qm
    dev = qm.device('projectq.ibm', wires=2, user="XXX", password="XXX")
